# rule-project-jsonymous

- This startup is about creating a Data Platform focus on Observability
- Design is inspired from acreom App (https://github.com/Acreom/app). This branch is the copy of the master branch of the project
- The primary concurrent of this platform is "metaplane" (app.metaplane.dev)
- This project needs to work online through the application : app.neungbo
- The main goal is to provide complete alerting and vision of the entire Data Stack for a company (database, data warehouse, data lake, API etc...)
- The MVP (Minimum Viable Produt) of this platform is the ability to track any sources of Data with metrics (Observability) for PostgreSQL
- Always follow the plan in [plan.md](mdc:docs/plan.md). Don't modify the [plan.md](mdc:docs/plan.md) without my consent
- Always follow all the documents that are inside the "docs" folder for best practices, big pictures, small details, programmation languages
